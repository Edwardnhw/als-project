VOC-ALS Dataset
VOiCe signals acquired in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Overview
The VOC-ALS dataset contains voice recordings and clinical profiles collected to study speech-related biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Healthy Controls (HC). The dataset includes recordings of vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) and repetitions of syllables (/pa/, /ta/, /ka/), recorded via mobile devices under controlled conditions.

Participants:
ALS: 102 participants (65 males, 37 females) with varying dysarthria severity.
HC: 51 participants (32 males, 19 females).
Total Recordings: 1224 audio files from 153 participants.
Data Description
Recording Details:
Device: Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Android 9.0).
Sampling Rate: 8000 Hz, 16-bit resolution.
Environment: Quiet (< 30 dB), dry (humidity 35-40%), stress-free conditions.
Setup: Device held ~20 cm from the mouth, angled at ~45 degrees.
Data Includes:
Vowel Recordings:
Continuous vocalization of vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/ (5 seconds each).
Syllable Repetitions:
Fast repetitions of /pa/, /ta/, and /ka/ in a single breath.
Demographic and Clinical Profiles:
Features:
Demographics: Age, Sex, Onset Region.
Clinical: Diagnostic Delay, Disease Duration, FVC%, ALSFRS-R (total and subscores), King Clinical Stage, Muscle Strength (MRC), and PUMNS scores.
Acoustic Metrics:
Fundamental Frequency (F0): Mean and Standard Deviation.
Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR).
Local Jitter and Shimmer.
Features
Speech Features:

Linear Predictive Coding (LPC): Models the vocal tract's spectral envelope.
Log-Area Ratio (LAR): Represents differences in vocal tract area.
Cepstral Coefficients: Captures speech signal frequency dynamics.
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC): Focuses on human auditory perception.
Acoustic Metrics:

Mean and Standard Deviation of F0.
HNR, Local Jitter, Local Shimmer (for vowels and syllables).
